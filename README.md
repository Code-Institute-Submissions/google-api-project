#Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project

This is a Single-Page Application (SPA), that calls on the Google Maps API and the Google Places API to allow users to search for information about any city they are planning to travel to. 

##UX
This website is intended for people who are are searching for all the information needed of the city they are planning to visit next. They are able to:
Select a city
Find tourist attractions
Find accommodation
Find bars, restaurants and coffee shops

I wanted to show images of different cities in the index page with a simple CTA, and then open a modal with the google maps search.

##Features
I wanted to show images of different cities in the index page with a simple CTA button that when hovered the font becomes lightgray and has a pointer.
Once the button is clicked then open the Google Maps modal;

In this modal, On the top-left side the user can type the city they are looking for in an input;
On the top-right side there is a drop-down with the different locations: hotels, bars, restaurant, coffee shops, museums and parks. Once an option is selected, icons will drop on the map according the selection.
If this icon is clicked, there will be a info window displayed with the name of the establishment and its information.

All the links from the Info Window will open in a new tab as the attribute target="_blank" was used.
